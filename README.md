Conformance fixtures, expected reports, and acceptance corpus data for the
**jankurai** auditor. This repository is one member of the Jankurai split
family; read [`SPLIT.md`](SPLIT.md) for the family contract and
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for agent routing rules.

## Stack

This is a data/corpus repository, not a product surface. It ships the versioned
test corpus the jankurai auditor (Rust core + TypeScript/React/Vite product
surface + PostgreSQL truth + generated contracts + exception-only Python
AI/data service) is replayed against. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for how the corpus is organized.

## Quick start

```bash
# One-command setup (verify the corpus is present, stage output tree).
just setup

# Deterministic fast lane (corpus check + jankurai self-audit).
just fast

# Full local check: setup, fast, security, and self-audit.
just check
```

The full command surface lives in the root [`Justfile`](Justfile). Continuous
integration runs the same lanes under
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Layout

| `agent/` | machine-readable owner, test, generated-zone, and policy maps |
| `docs/` | architecture, testing, boundaries, release, and exception docs |
| `ops/` | pinned CI script entrypoints |
| `scripts/` | local CI helper |
